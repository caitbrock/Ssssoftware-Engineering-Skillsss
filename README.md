NEXT STEPS
Moving forward it would be great to:
1. Create an easy, medium and hard level to the game.
2. Add more interactivity between the game and the levels (adding a check mark or a note when each level is complete).
3. Add a timer to allow participants to time themselves while playing.
4. Add a scoreboard to keep track of the speed in which the game is completed.
